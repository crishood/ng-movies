# Turn a container component into a signal-based presentation component

# Challenge Description

In this challenge, we want to change the `MovieDetailsComponent` into a signal-based presentation component.

## Requirements

- Remove all dependency injection from `MovieDetailsComponent`. Instead, use an `InputSignal` to receive `MovieDetails`.
- Change your router config to add a resolver that fetches `MovieDetails` and passes the object as an input to `MovieDetailsComponent`.
  > ðŸ’¡ HINT: Your router dependency injection configuration will need to be updated to accommodate component input binding.
- Everything should work just like it did before.

## Other Considerations

- If you see the `data-test` attribute anywhere in the boilerplate don't remove it.

## Example of Finished Application

This is an example of what the functionality should look like for the completed exercise. If youâ€™d like to mimic this style, feel free to do so, but it is not required.
